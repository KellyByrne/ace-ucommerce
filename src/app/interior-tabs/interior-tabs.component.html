                <p><strong>Will credits from Penn Foster College transfer into another college degree program?</strong></p>
                <p>Penn Foster College credits have been accepted for transfer into colleges across the country. Students should check with a specific college to see if they accept our credits, as credit transfer can vary depending on the school. Also, the American Council on Education's College Credit Recommendation Service (ACE CREDIT) has evaluated and recommended college credit for many Penn Foster College courses. No form of accreditation guarantees that any learning institution will accept credits from any school as transfer credits.

                <p><strong>I live in Jamaica. Can I enroll in an individual college course?</strong></p>
                <p>Unfortunately, individual college courses are only available for individuals living in the United States. We do offer a variety of Bachelor, Associate and Undergraduate Certificate programs for non-U.S. residents through our sister school, <a href="http://www.pennfostercollegeintl.com/programs_degrees.html" title="Penn Foster College International" target="_blank">Penn Foster College International</a>.</p>
